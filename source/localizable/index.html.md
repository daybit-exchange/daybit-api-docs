# Introduction

Target audience of this document is those who are capable of writing proper program source code. This document contains examples that might put your assets in danger, even losing your assets. You need to fully understand descriptions and functionalities of the source code before run them. Use this API at your own risk and all kinds of outcomes of using this API is your responsibility. Please refer [Terms of Service for Daybit API]https://www.daybit.com/policy/terms-api) for details.

You need to generate an API key pair from [Daybit](https://www.daybit.com) before using Daybit API. An API key pair has multiple types of authorization - receiving [Candle data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) or [Order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_(trading)), checking personal assets, trading personal assets, and withdrawal authorizations. Please refer [Authorization](#authorization) for details of authorization.

There are two types of Daybit APIs. First one is an [API Call](#api-calls) - client sends a request and server responds accordingly. Usually this type of APIs is used for asset trading, deposit or withdraw. Second type is a [API Subscription](#subscriptions) which allows you to subscribe to an API and keep getting a notification from Daybit API server. There are API subscriptions which includes price change of coins, information of one's wallet, result of one's order and so on.

Daybit APIs are implemented based on websocket connection and follow the format defined in [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/). Daybit also provides [Pydaybit](#pydaybit) written in Python which allows users to easily use Daybit API.

If you are not familiar with programming, it would be better to take a look at examples of [Pydaybit](#pydaybit) first.
 
# Authorization

Before you are using Daybit APIs, you first need to generate API key pair with proper authorization. An API key pair has multiple types of authorization - receiving [candle data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candlestick_chart) or a [order book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_book_(trading)), checking personal assets, trading personal assets, and withdrawal authorizations.

The usage of APIs is restricted by given right to each API key pair. You would get `unauthenticated` response error_code if you called an API that is not accessible from your API key pair. Please look above for types of API key pair and details of it.

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| public_data | Authorized to access public data (ex, Market Summary, Order Book and so on). To get this authorization level from an API key, please include `Market Inquiry` at the API key pair creation.
| private_data | Authorized to access private data (ex, Asset and so on). To get this authorization level from an API key, please include `Private Asset Inquiry` at the API key pair creation.
| trade | Authorized to call trade related APIs (ex, Order, Trade and so on). To get this authorization level from an API key, please include `Trading API` at the API key pair creation.
| transaction | Authorized to call transaction related APIs (ex, Deposit, Withdrawal and so on). To get this authorization level from API key, please include `Withdrawal API` at the API key pair creation.

You can generate maximum 5 API key pairs per account in [API Keys](https://www.daybit.com/mypage/api-managements) tab in My Page. Each API Key pair can have following authorizations:

* `public_data`
* `public_data`, `private_data`, `trade`
* `public_data`, `private_data`, `transaction`
* `public_data`, `private_data`, `trade`, `transaction`

# Host address

* Daybit API endpoint : [wss://api.daybit.com/v1/user_api_socket/websocket/](wss://api.daybit.com/v1/user_api_socket/websocket/)

# APIs
There are two types of Daybit's APIs. First one is an [API Call](#api-calls) - client sends a request and server responds accordingly. Usually this type of a call is used for asset trading, deposit or withdraw. Second type is a [Subscription](#subscriptions) which allows you to subscribe to an API and keep getting a notification from the server. Based on type of the notification, it includes price change of coins, information of one's wallet, result of one's order and so on.

## Channels
Channels are based on a simple idea of [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) that sending and receiving messages. Senders broadcast messages about [topics](#topics). Receivers subscribe to [topics](#topics) so that they can get those messages. Senders and receivers can switch roles on the same topic at any time. For details, refer to [Phoenix Documents](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/channels.html).

### Topics
Topics are string identifiers of [channels](#channels) that the various layers use in order to make sure messages end up in the right place. Daybit APIs are using following types of topics.

* [`/api`](#api-calls)
* [`/subscription:coins`](#coins)
* [`/subscription:market_summaries;<market_summary_intvl>`](#market_summaries)

### Events
Event is a `string` representing specific actions of the channel. `"phx_join"` is for joinning the channel and `"phx_leave"` is for leaving the channel. Daybit [API Calls](#api-calls) include types of request in event.
 
### Messages

> Example of `create_wdrl` 

```python
import asyncio
import logging

from pydaybit import Daybit

logger = logging.getLogger('pydaybit')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(message)s'))
logger.addHandler(stream_handler)


async def daybit_create_wdrl():
    async with Daybit() as daybit:
        await daybit.create_wdrl(coin='BTC', to_addr='ABTCADDRESS', amount='0.05')


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(daybit_create_wdrl())
```

> Output of the example

```console
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "1", "topic": "/api", "event": "phx_join", "payload": {"timestamp": 1538739991045}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/api","ref":"1","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{}},"event":"phx_reply"}
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "2", "topic": "/api", "event": "create_wdrl", "payload": {"to_addr": "ABTCADDRESS", "timestamp": 1538739991059, "coin": "BTC", "amount": "0.05"}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/api","ref":"2","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{"data":{"wdrl_to_tag":null,"wdrl_to_org":null,"wdrl_to_addr":"ABTCADDRESS","wdrl_status":"queued","type":"wdrl","txid":null,"tx_link_url":"https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/tx/","req_confirm":2,"id":5882,"deposit_status":null,"created_at":1538739991072,"confirm":0,"completed_at":null,"coin":"BTC","amount":"0.050000000000000000"}}},"event":"phx_reply"}
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "3", "topic": "/api", "event": "phx_leave", "payload": {"timestamp": 1538739991124}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/api","ref":"3","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{}},"event":"phx_reply"}
< {"topic":"/api","ref":"1","payload":{},"event":"phx_close"}
```

Following properties is delivered in the format of [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) object. The example shows messages on the websocket between a client and Daybit API server when the client calls `create_wdrl`.

* `topic` - The string identifier of a channel. for example [`"/api"`](#api-calls) or [`"/subscription:coins"`](#coins)
* `event` - The string event name. for example [`"create_order"`](#create_order), [`"cancel_order"`](#cancel_order), `"phx_join"`, `"phx_leave"`, and so on
* `payload` - The message payload
* `ref` - The unique string ref
* `join_ref` - ref of joinning the channel

## API Calls
You may connect to [Daybit API endpoint](#host-address) through a websocket and join `/api` channel. Then you can  call a API by sending message with proper `event` among followings.

### Channel of API Calls
All API calls should use `/api` channel.

### API Call List
In `/api` channel, set `event` property with a API name . Available API call list are following.

* [`create_order`](#create_order)
* [`cancel_order`](#cancel_order)
* [`cancel_orders`](#cancel_orders)
* [`cancel_all_my_orders`](#cancel_all_my_orders)
* [`create_wdrl`](#create_wdrl)
* [`get_server_time`](#get_server_time)

<aside class="notice">
It is recommended to retrieve data from <code>notification</code> of <code>subscription:&ltsub_topic&gt</code> channel, not response from <code>/api</code> channel.

## Subscriptions

> Example of `coins`

```python
import asyncio
import logging

from pydaybit import Daybit

logger = logging.getLogger('pydaybit')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()

    async with Daybit() as daybit:
        await daybit.coins()


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(daybit_coins())
```

> Output

< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"3","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{}},"event":"phx_reply"}
< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"1","payload":{},"event":"phx_close"}
```

For using API Subscriptions, first you need to join `/subscription:<subtopic>` channel and send `request` event. Once you are successfully subscribed by joinning a channel, Daybit API server sends `notification` for any kind of updated data. 

### API Subscription Channels
Subscription Channels are following. The topic of each channels has `/subscription:<subtopic>` format. For example, In case of the topic of `coins` channel is `/subscription:coins`.

* [`coins`](#coins)
* [`coin_prices`](#coin_prices)
* [`quote_coins`](#quote_coins)
* [`markets`](#markets)
* [`market_summary_intvls`](#market_summary_intvls)
* [`market_summaries`](#market_summaries)
* [`order_books`](#order_books)
* [`price_history_intvls`](#price_history_intvls)
* [`price_histories`](#price_histories)
* [`trades`](#trades), [`my_users`](#my_users)
* [`my_assets`](#my_assets)
* [`my_orders`](#my_orders)
* [`my_trades`](#my_trades)
* [`my_tx_summaries`](#my_tx_summaries)
* [`my_airdrop_histories`](#my_airdrop_histories) are the topics you can use in API subscriptions.

### Event of API Subscriptions
`request` is a push event and `notification` is a pull event. [Message](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Socket.Message.html) transported from client and server have `request` and `notification` events, respectively. When you subscribe to an API, i.e., joining the channel related to the API and sending a message with `request` event, you will get either `init` or `upsert` action response from the channel. After that, you would get one of `insert`, `update`, `upsert`, or `delete` from the channel with `notification` event. For more information of actions, please look following [Action](#action).

### Rate Limit of API Subscriptions
Limit of messages which have `request` event for every second.

> Example of `coins`

```python
import asyncio
import logging

from pydaybit import Daybit

logger = logging.getLogger('pydaybit')
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

stream_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
stream_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(message)s'))
logger.addHandler(stream_handler)


async def daybit_coins():
    async with Daybit() as daybit:
        await daybit.coins()


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(daybit_coins())
```

> Output

```console
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "1", "topic": "/subscription:coins", "event": "phx_join", "payload": {"timestamp": 1538740890363}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"1","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{}},"event":"phx_reply"}
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "2", "topic": "/subscription:coins", "event": "request", "payload": {"timestamp": 1538740890374}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"2","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{"data":[{"data":[{"wdrl_fee":"5.00000000","wdrl_enabled":true,"wdrl_confirm":2,"tradable":true,"tick_amount":"0.10000000","sym":"USDT","native_decimal_places":2,"name":"Tether","min_wdrl":"10.00000000","min_deposit":"10.00000000","has_tag":false,"has_org":false,"deposit_enabled":true,"deposit_confirm":2} ... ],"action":"init"}]}},"event":"phx_reply"}
> {"join_ref": "1", "ref": "3", "topic": "/subscription:coins", "event": "phx_leave", "payload": {"timestamp": 1538740890386}, "timeout": 3000}
< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"3","payload":{"status":"ok","response":{}},"event":"phx_reply"}
< {"topic":"/subscription:coins","ref":"1","payload":{},"event":"phx_close"}
```

## Rate limit

Each API has limit of calls for every second. You will get `api_exceeded_rate_limit` error_code in response if you exceeded the limit.

## Timestamp

All request takes `timestamp` and `timeout` to prevent unexpected calls because of network delay and so on.

- `timestamp`: `unix_timestamp`
- `timeout`(**optional**): `ms` unit time in `integer`. Default value is `3000` which means 3 seconds.

A request will be rejected in next condition: `server time` - `timestamp` > `timeout`.

If there was a problem, below error_code will be returned in response.

- `api_invalid_timestamp_or_timeout`: `timestamp` and/or `timeout` are not existed or they are not `integer` (unix timestamp in millisecond).
- `api_timeout`: Rejected because of request time out.

## Response format

Basically there are two types of response formats. Based on the result of API calls, you would get one of success or fail models. Please see success and fail response examples on right column. You can also find [Error List](#error-list) in below.

> Success

```python
{
  # plain json object with proper data
}
```

> Fail

```python
{
  "error_code": 'string',
  "message": 'string'
}
```
